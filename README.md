# The_Sparks_Foundation-Internship-
The Sparks Foundation is an organization that inspires, motivates, and encourages students to learn, create, and help build a better society, teach new ways of thinking, innovate, and solve the problems on their own.

From this internship, I learned about supervised, unsupervised machine learning, and business analytics..
